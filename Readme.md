## XAML Lab
A tool to create a WinUI3 Visually. Supports export to XAML and preview of the UI.
Supported elements don't include all their attributes - work is in progress.
There is a collection of templates that can be used to start with.
Some controls offer C++ small code snippets.
You can preview IDL/H/XAML/CPP code with F8.

There is a direct download executable [here](https://www.turbo-play.com/update2/tu.php?p=f3cf159b-de75-4427-8fe0-81a7ae61d3fa&f=88887777-A932-7654-A2E5-DECB481E355D).
The executable is updated automatically when you run it, so you always have the latest version.

## Menu Designer
There is also a menu designer that allows you to create menus visually. Then these menus can be loaded to MenuBar. There is a collection of menu templates as well.

You can preview the UI in a full window with or without title, or within a ContentDialog. You can also export the result in XAML.

## Supported elements so far
Many UIElement/FrameworkElement elements are supported. Work is in progress.

## Event callbacks
You can add a function callback and it's shown in.H/CPP/XAML files
